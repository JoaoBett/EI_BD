All data e stored in two-dimension tables

Primary Key (PK)
    -cannot be null
    -cannot be duplicated

Foreign Keys (FK)
    -should not be null
    -values refered to the primary key

Relational databases:
    -Many users at the same time
    -small ammounts of data

    -!= big ammounts of data each time(bulk loads)
    -!= use big ammounts of data(UPDATE REMOVES)

Problems
    -unclear data(meanign of something "R. das Amoreiras"(Rua? Rotunda?))
    -inconsistency
    -redundancy
        -rebuilding database solves the problem

-Normalization (6 normal forms)
    -The first 3 are the most important ones
    -First normal form
        -solves data manipulation issues
            -!= columns with the same meanign
            -!= cells with more than one value
    -Second normal form
        -redundancy
    -Third normal form
        -redundancy
    -...
