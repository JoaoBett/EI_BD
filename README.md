# EI_BD

## Introduction

This is a class of the second year, first semestre in IPL(Instituto Polit√©cnico de Leiria). Here we learn the basics about database, SQL and NOSQL database systems.

## Getting Started

In this class, we had to work with a supermarket DB. 


## Technologies

- **Oracle SQL Developer**: Oracle's integrated development environment for working with SQL databases.

- **Mongo DB**: A popular NoSQL database system for managing unstructured data. Althought we talked for just a few classes, in my opinion, not enough to get a good knowledge.

## Oracle SQL Developer

Oracle SQL Developer is a powerful tool for working with Oracle databases.

## Mongo DB

MongoDB is a leading NoSQL database that is known for its flexibility in handling unstructured data.
